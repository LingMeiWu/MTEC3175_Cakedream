You've done all you can now and M3p appears from the bushes.
M3p: "mellow im back, it's been a long while now so it's time to go back. We have to bake the cake before you wake up from the dream."

A sudden urge arises[[cake]]

:: cake [m3pCloverHutInBG]{"position":"851,468.5","size":"100,100"}
After finishing the sweet snack, you suddenly have an urge to eat a cake. Sadly, Clover didn’t prepare any cake & you decided to make one! 
Your inner self calls you to make a cake; this is your destiny. 

Clover: “Aight, now this is a fantasy world of yours. Your goal is to adventure throughout the space & gather the ingredients for your cake. 
Since I am a nice four leaf Clover, I shall bestow some luck on you by first giving you one of the ingredients you need.”

Clover extends her hands with some sort of golden eggs towards you.

Take the first ingredients[[first ingredients]]


:: first ingredients [eggHutInBG] {"position":"855,601.5","size":"100,100"}
Clover: “Which are the golden Phoenix eggs, be proud & happy that you didn’t need to meet the proud and egoistic Phoenix mama. 
Here is the list of what you’ll need, let your wild imagination guide you to the ingredients no need for maps!”
You look at the list of ingredients handed by Clover. They include Unicorn’s milk, mermaids pearl, hidden beach sand, and Monkey’s boonanas.

Which way would you like to travel to? (We are currently at the East.)

To the North[[Mermaids pearl]]
To the West[[Monkey’s boonanas]]



:: Mermaids pearl [dryWhaleBeachBG] {"position":"668,752.5","size":"100,100"}
You’ve decided to head North and you can smell the ocean air. As you approach closer to the beach, you see a very big blue figure ahead. Omg look, it’s a giant whale! 
Instinctively, you run toward the giant whale and see what you can do to help the whale. You get closer to the giant whale and you can hear the whale speaking to you. 
The giant whale lets out a very deep sound but is very weak. 

What will you do? 

Run around the beach & look for help[[look for help]]
Start splashing water at the whale[[splash water]]


:: Monkey’s boonanas [monkeyBeach] {"position":"1079,700.5","size":"100,100"}
You decided to head for the West.
After somewhat of a short walk, you found a beach with palm trees filled with boonanas & monkey’s surrounding it. 
The monkey seems to be angry monke. 

What will you do?

Approach the monkeys[[Approach the monkeys]]
Do not approach the monkeys[[Do not approach the monkeys]]

:: Approach the monkeys [monkey] {"position":"993,828.5","size":"100,100"}
You decided to approach the monkeys.

The monke security tightens as you run away. You have failed to retrieve the boonanas and decided to move on to another ingredient.

To the North[[Mermaids pearl]]


:: Do not approach the monkeys [banana] {"position":"1158,825.5","size":"100,100"}
You’ve decided to not approach the monke & they have suddenly retreated back into their cave. You take this chance to pick up a few boonanas that the monke left behind. 

You’ve successfully retrieved a few nice boonanas! Onto the next ingredient! 

To the North[[Mermaids pearl]]



:: eyes [m3pBlackBG] {"position":"483,295.5","size":"100,100"}
You slowly squint your eyes to check who it could be.A small white blob sits on top of you. 
???: “Are you awake now? Cause if you are we need to get going!”
The white blob jumps off you and you sit up.

Look around you[[surroundings]]


:: surroundings [trees]{"position":"475,429.5","size":"100,100"}
Surrounding you is not the bedroom that you were just in but a forest. 
You conclude that it's just a dream since you remember going to bed, and if you were to sleepwalk you would still be around society or at home.

Ask the white blob a question?[[question white blob]]

:: follow white blob [hut]{"position":"477,678.5","size":"100,100"}
You arrive at a small little hut with a tiny flower filled garden in the front.
M3p: “she’s waiting inside so let’s go in”

You walk to the front of the door. This place is quite overgrown with nature but it’s well maintained.

Knock on the door[[knock]]

:: look for help [beach] {"position":"600,895.5","size":"100,100"}
You’ve decided to run around the beach & look for help. M3p is following you but she is not giving you assistance. You have no luck in finding anyone to help you.
You even got lost at the beach yourself and you don’t remember how to get back to the giant whale. M3p saw how long you took to assist the whale and she already long helped the giant whale back into the ocean.

Night hits and you are still around the beach.

Head back to Clover's hut[[Head back to Clover's hut]]

:: splash water [wetWhaleBeachBG] {"position":"774,898.5","size":"100,100"}
You’ve decided to start splashing water on the giant whale with your hands and luckily a bucket somehow rolls on your feet.
You took this opportunity and used the bucket to your advantage. You kept splashing water on the whale avoiding their blowhole until night hit.

Even though you were unsure if this is the right choice, soon you knew this was not a waste of time.

Keep splashing water on the whale[[splash 2]]

:: splash 2 [beach]{"position":"774,1048.5","size":"100,100"}
As it got darker, the giant whale somehow got their energy back and they used their fins and flipped themselves back into the ocean. The giant whale swam away deep into the ocean
You felt very happy that the giant whale managed to survive and you dropped onto the sand on your back. 
You hear a strong deep sound coming back from the ocean.

Sit up and look towards the ocean[[Sit up and look towards the ocean]]

:: Sit up and look towards the ocean [happyWhaleMermaidBG]{"position":"774,1198.5","size":"100,100"}
You sat up and stared out to the ocean.

The giant whale is staring right at you but they aren’t alone. A mermaid is approaching you and you walk towards her near the water.

As both of you get closer, the mermaid reveal her hands holding a pouch. Will you take it?

Take the pouch [[Take the pouch]]
Don't take the pouch [[Don't take the pouch]]

:: Take the pouch [pearlBeachBG]{"position":"653,1348.5","size":"100,100"}
You gladly take the pouch from the mermaid's hands. The mermaid mumble some words you don’t understand. But she bowed and swam away. 

Before the giant whale dive back into the ocean, they make a very high yet deep sound and spray water out of their blowhole. It’s like the giant whale is saying thank you to you.

You've obtained the Mermaids pearl! 

Head back to Clover's hut[[Head back to Clover's hut]]

:: Don't take the pouch [beach] {"position":"893,1348.5","size":"100,100"}
You decided to not take the pouch from The mermaid...
The mermaid looks sadden by your decision and swam away. 

Before the giant whale dive back into the ocean, they make a low and deep noise and the sound of the noise makes you feel a little bit sad. Maybe you should've taken their gratitude?

As you enjoy looking around the scenery, you hear rustling behind you. You turned around and there is a shining Unicorn behind you. You were surprised but you didn’t freak out.The unicorn passed by you and started drinking from the waterfall.Suddenly, the water from the waterfall turned milky white.
You were astounded and wondered how to gather the milk. You realize you don’t have a jar. 
Then suddenly you notice on top of the waterfall, there is a jar flowing down the stream.
How lucky you thought. You use this to your advantage and use the jar to gather the milk.

On the table, there is a note.

Read the note[[Read the note]]

:: Read the note [noteLabBG] {"position":"848,1627.5","size":"100,100"}

The Jar of Sand is literally right in front of you. You decided to take the jar anyways. M3p saw what happened and decided to place a curse on the specific jar of sand you took. 

Before you leave the room, you feel the Jar of Sand getting hot and you look at the jar turning into steam and the jar exploded into thin air. You luckily didn't get hurt but you've achived nothing. 

Exit the room[[Exit the room]]

You slowly exit the waterfall and calmly so you don’t alert what’s outside. When you finally exit the waterfall, you see a stunning white unicorn. 
You decided to stay where you are as the unicorn drink the water
Then suddenly, the water turned milky white and you were astounded by this. The unicorn left the vicinity and you took this opportunity and gathered the milk.
